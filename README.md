## Intro

This application supports a wide range of adjustments. Allowing you, not only to reset your input parameters,
but also to rethink the output structure by adjusting it's granularity levels. Greater versions may even allow
us to compare the application performance using different configfile extentions (such as Json, Parquet or CSV).
